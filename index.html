    I’m a high school lacrosse player and have been dedicated to the sport since 2022. Lacrosse has taught me discipline, teamwork, and the value of perseverance, all of which have shaped me both on and off the field.
Beyond sports, I have a passion for learning about history, cultures, and religions. Exploring the past and understanding diverse traditions helps me appreciate the rich complexity of the world around me.
I also enjoy staying active through weightlifting, which challenges me to grow stronger and stay focused. In my downtime, I like playing Valorant—it’s a fun way to unwind while sharpening my strategic thinking. I’ve also found a creative outlet in streaming, where I get to connect with others, share my interests, and just enjoy being myself
